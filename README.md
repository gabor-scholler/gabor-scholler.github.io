# WW2 Project 
**Last Update: Tuesday, 25 January 2022**

This project aims to make learning about the Second World War easier! Users have access to quizzes, timelines, a growing encyclopedia, and much more! As of now,
I'm working on this alone, so please be patient with updates - I've got school work! Anyway, WW2 have long been of interest to me, and since there's no existing website 
to learn about this time, I thought I'd give it a try and make one myself :)

**Link can be found below the 'Checklist'.**

- [x] Homepage
- [x] About Us
- [x] Timeline (not fully completed, but it's working well)
